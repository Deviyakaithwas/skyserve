Full Stack Assignment-01: Building a Geo-Data App

You are tasked with building a fullstack web application that allows users to manage and visualize geospatial data. The application consists of a backend written in Go and a frontend built with React/Next.js. Users should be able to create an account, upload GeoJSON or KML files, render these files on a map using React Leaflet, draw custom shapes on the map, save those shapes, and edit them.
